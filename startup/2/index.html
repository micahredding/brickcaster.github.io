What are you getting into? Are you building the pyramids or the botanical gardens? Is this a build-it-and-walk-away situation, or an ongoing endeavor requiring loving care and upkeep? Know what you're getting into, and learn how to think about the significance of your role in the project. <a href="http://brickcaster.com/startup/2">Read our detailed notes here</a>.</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Planning</strong></p><p>You do planning &mdash; but you have to be open to change. Sometimes you have to move things around, sometimes things die, sometimes you have to replace them.</p><p><strong>A process of learning and discovery</strong></p><p>There's an element of discovery. This tool isn't quite what we thought it was &mdash; this library needs to be replaced &mdash; we aren't building the same thing twice.</p><p>We're learning about the tools, we're learning about the problem space, we're learning about the business.</p><p><strong>We're not building the same thing twice</strong></p><p>You could buy a ready-made garden off the shelf. But when you want to add something new, you need to start over.</p><p>When you've got well-defined problems (Wordpress blog, simple ecommerce) pre-packaged solutions make sense. But when you're building something new, for a new business case, then you approach it as a learning experience.</p><p><strong>The environment changes as well</strong></p><p>The environment (not just the tools) might be changing. The business need and business setting may be changing during the process of development.</p><p><strong>Software is soft, buildings are not</strong></p><p>Boundaries around what you're building tend to be much more ambiguous.</p><p>Plants have roots. Those roots can become entangled. That can create problems.</p><p>Developers deal with this problem: how to keep entanglements down. How to keep your software flexible. How to make sure that when you remove this one feature, other features down come with it.</p><p>This often depends on really understanding the way your business concepts actually interrelate at a deep level. Misunderstandings up front lead to unwanted entanglements.</p><p>Allowing for flexibility allows us to discover and work around potential entanglements.</p><p><strong>The well maintained garden produces more</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A garden needs maintained over time.</li>
  <li>Software has a life-cycle.</li>
  <li>It will be a different thing six months out, a year out, two years out.</li>
  <li>You need professional cultivators.</li>
</ul><p><strong>You could cultivate:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple projects yourself.</li>
  <li>Mid-tier projects can bring in professionals periodically.</li>
  <li>Larger projects need full-time professional care.</li>
</ul><p>It's never done, never finished, always growing, always changing.</p><p><strong>Web development offers the ability to deploy more often</strong></p><hr>Ep 2: Programming as Gardening<br>Micah Redding<br><br>1240<br><hr></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer></footer></body></html>
